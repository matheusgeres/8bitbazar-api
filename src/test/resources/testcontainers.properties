# Testcontainers configuration
# This file configures Testcontainers to work with both Docker and Podman

# For Podman support, Testcontainers will automatically detect
# the container runtime based on environment variables

# Ryuk is used to clean up containers after tests
# Set to false if you have issues with Podman
# testcontainers.ryuk.disabled=false

# Reuse containers between test runs (faster tests)
testcontainers.reuse.enable=true
